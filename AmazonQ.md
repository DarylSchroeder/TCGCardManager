# TCG Card Manager - Layout Restructuring

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Search Results Display
- Changed from a grid of large card images to a more compact list view with thumbnails
- Each card now displays as a row with:
  - Small thumbnail image (60px Ã— 84px)
  - Card name and set information
  - ~~Select button~~ (Removed in latest update)

### 2. Improved UI Elements
- Added a scrollable container for search results with a maximum height
- Added visual feedback when a card is selected (blue border)
- Changed the card details header to blue for better visibility
- Added automatic scrolling to the card details when a card is selected
- Made entire card row clickable for easier selection (new)
- Enhanced hover and selection visual feedback (new)

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- More cards visible at once without scrolling
- Faster visual scanning of search results
- Clearer indication of the currently selected card
- Smoother transition between selecting a card and viewing its details
- Single-click card selection without needing to aim for a button (new)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Users can see more cards at once, making it easier to find the card they're looking for
2. **Reduced Scrolling**: The compact list view requires less scrolling than the previous grid layout
3. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between the search results and the selected card details
4. **Faster Loading**: Smaller thumbnail images load faster than full-sized card images
5. **Simplified Interaction**: Entire row is clickable, reducing precision needed to select cards (new)

## Future Enhancements

- Add sorting options for the search results (by name, set, price, etc.)
- Implement filtering options to narrow down search results
- Add keyboard navigation for the search results list
- Implement a "quick add" button directly in the list view for frequently added cards
### 4. Two-Column Layout (new)
- Restructured the UI into a two-column layout with 60/40 split (search/details)
- Search results now appear on the left side (60% width)
- Selected card details appear on the right side (40% width)
- Inventory table spans both columns at the bottom
- Fixed height for search and details row (500px) to prevent pushing inventory off screen
- Used flex layout to ensure proper content distribution
- Streamlined inventory table with smaller padding and moved export button to header
