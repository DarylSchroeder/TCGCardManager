# TCG Card Manager - Development Notes

## Recent Major Refactoring (July 28, 2025)

### What Was Done
A significant refactoring was completed that consolidated the application architecture:

#### Removed Files
- **Modular JS Structure**: Removed separate JS modules (`js/app.js`, `js/api.js`, `js/inventory.js`, etc.)
- **Separate Pricing Tool**: Removed `pricing.html` - functionality integrated into main app
- **Debug Files**: Cleaned up numerous debug and test files
- **Alternative Implementations**: Removed `index2.html` and other experimental files

#### Consolidated Architecture
- **Single File Application**: Everything now consolidated into `index.html`
- **Integrated Pricing**: Pricing functionality built directly into main interface
- **Simplified Structure**: Easier to maintain and deploy

### Current State

#### Core Files
- `index.html` - Main application (65KB, contains all functionality)
- `server.js` - Node.js server with Express-like routing
- `package.json` - Dependencies and npm scripts
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `run.sh` - Server startup script

#### Test Suite (Maintained)
- `test/csv.test.js` - CSV parsing and export tests
- `test/pricing.test.js` - TCG pricing rule validation
- `test/integration.test.js` - Import/export workflows
- `test/pricing-integration.test.js` - Full pricing workflow tests
- `test/run-tests.sh` - Comprehensive test runner

#### Key Features (Post-Refactoring)
- **Unified Interface**: Single page with integrated pricing tools
- **Update Prices Button**: Direct access to TCG pricing calculations
- **Import/Export**: CSV functionality maintained and improved
- **Two-Column Layout**: Optimized 60/40 split UI preserved
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite maintained

### Architecture Benefits

#### Simplified Deployment
- Single HTML file contains all client-side code
- Easier to understand and modify
- Reduced complexity for new developers

#### Maintained Functionality
- All core features preserved
- Pricing rules still fully implemented
- CSV import/export working correctly
- Test coverage maintained

#### Performance
- Reduced HTTP requests (everything in one file)
- Faster initial load
- Simplified caching strategy

### Current Workflow

#### For Users
1. Start server: `./run.sh`
2. Access app: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Search cards, manage inventory, update prices - all in one interface

#### For Developers
1. Run tests: `npm test` (or `./test/run-tests.sh`)
2. All functionality in `index.html`
3. Server configuration in `server.js`

### Documentation Updates Made
- Updated README.md to reflect single-file architecture
- Removed references to separate pricing tool
- Updated workflow descriptions
- Corrected server.js startup messages

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any functionality regressions
- Consider adding localStorage persistence for inventory
- Potential TypeScript conversion for better maintainability
- Performance monitoring with consolidated architecture

## Testing Status
âœ… All tests passing after refactoring
âœ… CSV functionality preserved
âœ… Pricing calculations working correctly
âœ… Import/export workflows functional
âœ… Integration tests successful

## Server Status
ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:3000/
ðŸ“‹ Main application accessible and functional
