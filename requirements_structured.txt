# TCG Card Manager - Project Overview and Requirements

## Project Context
This is a web application for managing trading card game collections, primarily focused on Magic: The Gathering cards. The application allows users to search for cards, view details, add them to inventory, and export the inventory as a CSV file.

## Version Control
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/DarylSchroeder/TCGCardManager.git
- Branches:
  - main (current)
  - temp_branch
- Recent Commits:
  - Fix search results scrolling with explicit height and overflow settings
  - Fix search results extending behind inventory panel
  - Adjust layout to 60/40 split and optimize for minimal scrolling
  - Implement two-column layout with search results on left and card details on right
  - Update requirements.txt to reflect implemented features
  - Improve pre-fetching functionality with configuration options and better error handling
  - Add User-Agent header to API requests to comply with Scryfall API requirements
- Ignored Files (via .gitignore):
  - Node.js dependencies (node_modules/)
  - Environment variables (.env)
  - Log files
  - OS generated files
  - Backup folder

## Project Structure
- `/root/code/tcg_card_manager/` - Root directory
  - `index.html` - Main HTML file with UI layout
  - `server.js` - Node.js server implementation
  - `app.js` - Main application logic
  - `run.sh` - Script to start the server
  - `/js/` - JavaScript modules directory
    - `api.js` - Handles API calls to Scryfall
    - `ui.js` - Manages UI updates and interactions
    - `inventory.js` - Manages the card inventory
    - `app.js` - Main application initialization
    - `imageCache.js` - Handles caching of card images
  - `AmazonQ.md` - Documentation of recent layout changes

## Recent Changes
We've implemented a two-column layout with a 60/40 split where search results appear on the left side (60% width) and selected card details appear on the right side (40% width). The inventory table spans both columns at the bottom. This layout improves efficiency and reduces scrolling.

## Core Features
1. Card Search
   - Integration with Scryfall API for comprehensive card data
   - Auto-search when pressing Enter in the search field
   - Display search results in a compact list view with thumbnails
   - Scrollable search results container with fixed height

2. Card Details
   - View high-quality card images
   - Display comprehensive card information
   - Blue header for better visibility
   - Compact form layout for adding cards to inventory

3. Inventory Management
   - Add cards with quantity, condition, and price information
   - View all cards in inventory in a table format
   - Export inventory as CSV file
   - Streamlined table with export button in header

4. Layout
   - Two-column layout with 60/40 split (search/details)
   - Fixed height for search and details row (500px)
   - Inventory table spans both columns at the bottom
   - Responsive design using Bootstrap 5

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5), Vanilla JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js server
- Data Storage: In-memory (no database)
- API Integration: Scryfall API (requires User-Agent header)
- Architecture: Modular JavaScript with separation of concerns

## Performance Optimizations
- Pre-fetch popular card images on server start
- Configurable limits to prevent memory issues
- Caching of set data (which changes infrequently)
- Proper error handling for API requests
- Smaller thumbnail images for faster loading

## User Workflow
1. Search for cards by name (e.g., "Counterspell")
2. Select a card from search results to view details
3. Add selected card to inventory with quantity, condition, and price
4. Export inventory as CSV when finished

## Future Enhancements
- Local storage to persist inventory between sessions
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- More detailed card information display
- Bulk import/export features
- Collection statistics and analytics
- Integration with TCGPlayer for price data
- Ability to adjust prices based on market data
- Add sorting options for the search results (by name, set, price, etc.)
- Implement filtering options to narrow down search results
- Add keyboard navigation for the search results list
- Implement a "quick add" button directly in the list view for frequently added cards

## Development Workflow
- We're working on the `main` branch for primary development
- The `temp_branch` exists for experimental features
- Commit changes regularly with descriptive commit messages
- Follow the existing code structure and modular approach
- Test changes locally before committing
- Push to GitHub repository for backup and collaboration
