# TCG Card Manager Requirements
# Version 1.0

# Core Features
- Search for cards using Scryfall API
- Display card images and details
- Add cards to inventory with quantity, condition, and price
- Export inventory as CSV

# Search features
- when typing a phrase, and the enter key is pressed, search automatically

# Technical Requirements
- Node.js server
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- Bootstrap 5 for styling
- No database required (in-memory storage)
- Calls to Scryfall require a User-Agent header.
- Modular code structure for better organization and maintainability

# Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
- Local storage to persist inventory between sessions
- Filtering and sorting options for search results
- More detailed card information
- Bulk import/export features
- Collection statistics and analytics

# Efficiency features 
- When the server starts, will pre-fetch popular card images from the Scryfall API (configurable)
- Limited to a configurable number of cards to avoid memory issues
- Proper error handling for API requests
- Sets are released infrequently.   Cache these results in the server. 

# Desired workflow
- I should be able to log into TCGPlayer, and export my current inventory, which is a CSV file.
- I should be able to upload a price list of all current magic cards. 
- I should be able to adjust my prices (see app tcgplayer_pricing_app)
- I should be able to import my inventory into memory of the app.
- I should be able to type names of cards such as "Counterspell" and get a search result with cards matching.   
- I should be able to quickly press one of the cards to add it to my inventory.
- I should be able to download my full inventory when completed.
